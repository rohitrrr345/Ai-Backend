# üöÄ Lead Scoring Backend Service

This project is a **Node.js + Express** backend service designed to automate and enhance the lead qualification process. It handles the processing of raw lead data from CSV files, persists the data in a **MongoDB** database, and utilizes the **Gemini AI** (`@google/genai`) to apply advanced analysis for generating highly accurate lead scores and intent labels.

## ‚ú® Features

* **CSV File Upload & Parsing:** Robust handling and parsing of uploaded CSV files containing lead data.
* **Hybrid Lead Scoring:** Combines a deterministic **Rule Layer** (up to 50 points based on role/industry) and an **AI Layer** (up to 50 points based on intent analysis).
* **AI-Based Intent Classification:** Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for deep analysis of lead profiles (e.g., LinkedIn Bio) against specific offer details to classify buying intent (**High/Medium/Low**) and provide reasoning.
* **MongoDB Integration:** Uses **Mongoose** for structured schema design and persistence of lead records and scores.
* **RESTful API:** Provides clear endpoints for file submission and accessing processed lead data.

}





üì§ POST /leads/upload/:offerId

Description:
Uploads a CSV file containing lead data associated with a specific offer.
The backend parses the CSV, processes each lead, and uses Gemini AI to calculate reasoning, intent, and lead scores.

Request

Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body: file (CSV file)

Params: offerId (from /offer/createOffer response)

Response Example
[
  {
    "name": "Ava Patel",
    "role": "Head of Growth",
    "company": "FlowMetrics",
    "aiPoints": 50,
    "intent": "High",
    "score": 80,
    "reasoning": "The lead is a Head of Growth at a B2B SaaS company, an ideal target for AI outreach automation. Her LinkedIn bio explicitly states a focus on scaling through automation, directly aligning with the offer's core value."
  },

‚öôÔ∏è Processing Flow

Upload CSV file ‚Üí Backend parses rows into JSON objects.

Each lead is analyzed using Gemini 2.5 Flash AI (@google/genai).

The AI model assigns:

intent ‚Üí High | Medium | Low

score ‚Üí Numeric value (0‚Äì100)

reasoning ‚Üí Short AI-generated explanation

Processed leads are stored in MongoDB under their corresponding offerId.

The server responds with a structured JSON containing scored leads.
