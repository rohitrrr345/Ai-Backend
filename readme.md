# üöÄ Lead Scoring Backend Service

This project is a **Node.js + Express** backend service designed to automate and enhance the lead qualification process. It handles the processing of raw lead data from CSV files, persists the data in a **MongoDB** database, and utilizes the **Gemini AI** (`@google/genai`) to apply advanced analysis for generating highly accurate lead scores and intent labels.

## ‚ú® Features

* **CSV File Upload & Parsing:** Robust handling and parsing of uploaded CSV files containing lead data.
* **Hybrid Lead Scoring:** Combines a deterministic **Rule Layer** (up to 50 points based on role/industry) and an **AI Layer** (up to 50 points based on intent analysis).
* **AI-Based Intent Classification:** Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for deep analysis of lead profiles (e.g., LinkedIn Bio) against specific offer details to classify buying intent (**High/Medium/Low**) and provide reasoning.
* **MongoDB Integration:** Uses **Mongoose** for structured schema design and persistence of lead records and scores.
* **RESTful API:** Provides clear endpoints for file submission and accessing processed lead data.
